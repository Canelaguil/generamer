\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyVerb}Routines to find the boundary of a set of nodes.

An edge boundary is a set of edges, each of which has exactly one
endpoint in a given set of nodes (or, in the case of directed graphs,
the set of edges whose source node is in the set).

A node boundary of a set *S* of nodes is the set of (out-)neighbors of
nodes in *S* that are outside *S*.\end{DoxyVerb}

\begin{DoxyVerb}Returns the edge boundary of `nbunch1`.

The *edge boundary* of a set *S* with respect to a set *T* is the
set of edges (*u*, *v*) such that *u* is in *S* and *v* is in *T*.
If *T* is not specified, it is assumed to be the set of all nodes
not in *S*.

Parameters
----------
G : NetworkX graph

nbunch1 : iterable
    Iterable of nodes in the graph representing the set of nodes
    whose edge boundary will be returned. (This is the set *S* from
    the definition above.)

nbunch2 : iterable
    Iterable of nodes representing the target (or "exterior") set of
    nodes. (This is the set *T* from the definition above.) If not
    specified, this is assumed to be the set of all nodes in `G`
    not in `nbunch1`.

keys : bool
    This parameter has the same meaning as in
    :meth:`MultiGraph.edges`.

data : bool or object
    This parameter has the same meaning as in
    :meth:`MultiGraph.edges`.

default : object
    This parameter has the same meaning as in
    :meth:`MultiGraph.edges`.

Returns
-------
iterator
    An iterator over the edges in the boundary of `nbunch1` with
    respect to `nbunch2`. If `keys`, `data`, or `default`
    are specified and `G` is a multigraph, then edges are returned
    with keys and/or data, as in :meth:`MultiGraph.edges`.

Notes
-----
Any element of `nbunch` that is not in the graph `G` will be
ignored.

`nbunch1` and `nbunch2` are usually meant to be disjoint, but in
the interest of speed and generality, that is not required here.\end{DoxyVerb}

\begin{DoxyVerb}Returns the node boundary of `nbunch1`.

The *node boundary* of a set *S* with respect to a set *T* is the
set of nodes *v* in *T* such that for some *u* in *S*, there is an
edge joining *u* to *v*. If *T* is not specified, it is assumed to
be the set of all nodes not in *S*.

Parameters
----------
G : NetworkX graph

nbunch1 : iterable
    Iterable of nodes in the graph representing the set of nodes
    whose node boundary will be returned. (This is the set *S* from
    the definition above.)

nbunch2 : iterable
    Iterable of nodes representing the target (or "exterior") set of
    nodes. (This is the set *T* from the definition above.) If not
    specified, this is assumed to be the set of all nodes in `G`
    not in `nbunch1`.

Returns
-------
set
    The node boundary of `nbunch1` with respect to `nbunch2`.

Notes
-----
Any element of `nbunch` that is not in the graph `G` will be
ignored.

`nbunch1` and `nbunch2` are usually meant to be disjoint, but in
the interest of speed and generality, that is not required here.\end{DoxyVerb}
