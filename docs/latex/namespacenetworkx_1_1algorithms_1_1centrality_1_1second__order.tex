\begin{DoxyVerb}Compute the second order centrality for nodes of G.

The second order centrality of a given node is the standard deviation of
the return times to that node of a perpetual random walk on G:

Parameters
----------
G : graph
  A NetworkX connected and undirected graph.

Returns
-------
nodes : dictionary
   Dictionary keyed by node with second order centrality as the value.

Examples
--------
>>> G = nx.star_graph(10)
>>> soc = nx.second_order_centrality(G)
>>> print(sorted(soc.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])[0][0])  # pick first id
0

Raises
------
NetworkXException
    If the graph G is empty, non connected or has negative weights.

See Also
--------
betweenness_centrality

Notes
-----
Lower values of second order centrality indicate higher centrality.

The algorithm is from Kermarrec, Le Merrer, Sericola and Trédan [1]_.

This code implements the analytical version of the algorithm, i.e.,
there is no simulation of a random walk process involved. The random walk
is here unbiased (corresponding to eq 6 of the paper [1]_), thus the
centrality values are the standard deviations for random walk return times
on the transformed input graph G (equal in-degree at each nodes by adding
self-loops).

Complexity of this implementation, made to run locally on a single machine,
is O(n^3), with n the size of G, which makes it viable only for small
graphs.
