\begin{DoxyVerb}Returns communicability between all pairs of nodes in G.

The communicability between pairs of nodes in G is the sum of
walks of different lengths starting at node u and ending at node v.

Parameters
----------
G: graph

Returns
-------
comm: dictionary of dictionaries
    Dictionary of dictionaries keyed by nodes with communicability
    as the value.

Raises
------
NetworkXError
   If the graph is not undirected and simple.

See Also
--------
communicability_exp:
   Communicability between all pairs of nodes in G  using spectral
   decomposition.
communicability_betweenness_centrality:
   Communicability betweeness centrality for each node in G.

Notes
-----
This algorithm uses a spectral decomposition of the adjacency matrix.
Let G=(V,E) be a simple undirected graph.  Using the connection between
the powers  of the adjacency matrix and the number of walks in the graph,
the communicability  between nodes `u` and `v` based on the graph spectrum
is [1]_

.. math::
    C(u,v)=\sum_{j=1}^{n}\phi_{j}(u)\phi_{j}(v)e^{\lambda_{j}},

where `\phi_{j}(u)` is the `u\rm{th}` element of the `j\rm{th}` orthonormal
eigenvector of the adjacency matrix associated with the eigenvalue
`\lambda_{j}`.

\begin{DoxyVerb}Returns communicability between all pairs of nodes in G.

Communicability between pair of node (u,v) of node in G is the sum of
walks of different lengths starting at node u and ending at node v.

Parameters
----------
G: graph

Returns
-------
comm: dictionary of dictionaries
    Dictionary of dictionaries keyed by nodes with communicability
    as the value.

NetworkXError

communicability_betweenness_centrality:
   Communicability betweeness centrality for each node in G.

Notes
-----
This algorithm uses matrix exponentiation of the adjacency matrix.

Let G=(V,E) be a simple undirected graph.  Using the connection between
the powers  of the adjacency matrix and the number of walks in the graph,
the communicability between nodes u and v is [1]_,

.. math::
    C(u,v) = (e^A)_{uv},

where `A` is the adjacency matrix of G.
