\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyVerb}Module to simplify the specification of user-defined equality functions for
node and edge attributes during isomorphism checks.

During the construction of an isomorphism, the algorithm considers two
candidate nodes n1 in G1 and n2 in G2.  The graphs G1 and G2 are then
compared with respect to properties involving n1 and n2, and if the outcome
is good, then the candidate nodes are considered isomorphic. NetworkX
provides a simple mechanism for users to extend the comparisons to include
node and edge attributes.

Node attributes are handled by the node_match keyword. When considering
n1 and n2, the algorithm passes their node attribute dictionaries to
node_match, and if it returns False, then n1 and n2 cannot be
considered to be isomorphic.

Edge attributes are handled by the edge_match keyword. When considering
n1 and n2, the algorithm must verify that outgoing edges from n1 are
commensurate with the outgoing edges for n2. If the graph is directed,
then a similar check is also performed for incoming edges.

Focusing only on outgoing edges, we consider pairs of nodes (n1, v1) from
G1 and (n2, v2) from G2. For graphs and digraphs, there is only one edge
between (n1, v1) and only one edge between (n2, v2). Those edge attribute
dictionaries are passed to edge_match, and if it returns False, then
n1 and n2 cannot be considered isomorphic. For multigraphs and
multidigraphs, there can be multiple edges between (n1, v1) and also
multiple edges between (n2, v2).  Now, there must exist an isomorphism
from "all the edges between (n1, v1)" to "all the edges between (n2, v2)".
So, all of the edge attribute dictionaries are passed to edge_match, and
it must determine if there is an isomorphism between the two sets of edges.
