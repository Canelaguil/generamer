\begin{DoxyVerb}Compute current-flow betweenness centrality for subsets of nodes.

Current-flow betweenness centrality uses an electrical current
model for information spreading in contrast to betweenness
centrality which uses shortest paths.

Current-flow betweenness centrality is also known as
random-walk betweenness centrality [2]_.

Parameters
----------
G : graph
  A NetworkX graph

sources: list of nodes
  Nodes to use as sources for current

targets: list of nodes
  Nodes to use as sinks for current

normalized : bool, optional (default=True)
  If True the betweenness values are normalized by b=b/(n-1)(n-2) where
  n is the number of nodes in G.

weight : string or None, optional (default=None)
  Key for edge data used as the edge weight.
  If None, then use 1 as each edge weight.
  The weight reflects the capacity or the strength of the
  edge.

dtype: data type (float)
  Default data type for internal matrices.
  Set to np.float32 for lower memory consumption.

solver: string (default='lu')
   Type of linear solver to use for computing the flow matrix.
   Options are "full" (uses most memory), "lu" (recommended), and
   "cg" (uses least memory).

Returns
-------
nodes : dictionary
   Dictionary of nodes with betweenness centrality as the value.

See Also
--------
approximate_current_flow_betweenness_centrality
betweenness_centrality
edge_betweenness_centrality
edge_current_flow_betweenness_centrality

Notes
-----
Current-flow betweenness can be computed in $O(I(n-1)+mn \log n)$
time [1]_, where $I(n-1)$ is the time needed to compute the
inverse Laplacian.  For a full matrix this is $O(n^3)$ but using
sparse methods you can achieve $O(nm{\sqrt k})$ where $k$ is the
Laplacian matrix condition number.

The space required is $O(nw)$ where $w$ is the width of the sparse
Laplacian matrix.  Worse case is $w=n$ for $O(n^2)$.

If the edges have a 'weight' attribute they will be used as
weights in this algorithm.  Unspecified weights are set to 1.
