\begin{DoxyVerb}Returns a new rooted tree with a root node joined with the roots
of each of the given rooted trees.

Parameters
----------
rooted_trees : list
    A list of pairs in which each left element is a NetworkX graph
    object representing a tree and each right element is the root
    node of that tree. The nodes of these trees will be relabeled to
    integers.

label_attribute : str
    If provided, the old node labels will be stored in the new tree
    under this node attribute. If not provided, the node attribute
    ``'_old'`` will store the original label of the node in the
    rooted trees given in the input.

Returns
-------
NetworkX graph
    The rooted tree whose subtrees are the given rooted trees. The
    new root node is labeled 0. Each non-root node has an attribute,
    as described under the keyword argument ``label_attribute``,
    that indicates the label of the original node in the input tree.

Notes
-----
Graph, edge, and node attributes are propagated from the given
rooted trees to the created tree. If there are any overlapping graph
attributes, those from later trees will overwrite those from earlier
trees in the tuple of positional arguments.

Examples
--------
Join two full balanced binary trees of height *h* to get a full
balanced binary tree of depth *h* + 1::

    >>> h = 4
    >>> left = nx.balanced_tree(2, h)
    >>> right = nx.balanced_tree(2, h)
    >>> joined_tree = nx.join([(left, 0), (right, 0)])
    >>> nx.is_isomorphic(joined_tree, nx.balanced_tree(2, h + 1))
    True\end{DoxyVerb}
